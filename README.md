This repository contains the data and code for the Master's thesis "Contrasting English and Finnish Language Use on Finnish Twitter: Feature-specific Differences and Sociolinguistic Realities in Finland". 

## Data




## Scripts

The four Python scripts in this repository contain the code that was used to analyse the data. The file `frequency-analysis-1.py` contains the code used to conduct the initial frequency analysis of the data, including the language distribution across accounts and locations, as well as the interactional analysis. The file `preprocessing-and-frequency-analysis-2.py` contains the code used for data preprocessing (cleaning the data, tokenisation, lemmatisation) and first textual analyses, such as analysis of tweet length and type-token-ratio.

The code used in the course of the emoji analysis can be found in `emoji-analysis.py`. It includes an analysis of emoji statistics, emoji popularity, and emoji distribution across locations. The file `topic-modelling-analysis.py` contains the code for the topic modelling analysis (building and running the models, hyperparameter tuning, and model analysis).
